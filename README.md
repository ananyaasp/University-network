# University-network
This project designs a university network connecting a Main Campus and a Side Campus using routers and a multilayer switch. The core of the network is a central distribution switch that handles inter-VLAN routing and connects multiple departmental switches across both campuses.
Each department is assigned its own VLAN and subnet, helping to organize devices like PCs and printers while improving security and network performance. Servers are placed in a dedicated VLAN to provide centralized services such as DHCP and DNS.
Overall, the network is structured to be scalable, secure, and efficientâ€”mirroring a real-world university setup with clear departmental separation and reliable connectivity between campuses.
